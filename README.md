# 👨🏻‍🌾 That's My Farmer! - ASP .NET Core Final Project 👨🏻‍🌾
# Description

This is the final source code for the final ASP .NET Core project that was created for the purpose of the Developing ASP .NET Applications programming course, with professor [Gregory Prokopski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prokopski/) 🔗.

Considering the short length of the course, we opted for a really simple design, and focused our energies on backend functionnalities.

Using the MS Visual Studio Code IDE, we created an ASP .NET Core/Razor Pages Web application that delivers dynamic content.  

In this course, we learned about the fundamentals of Web application site implementation by using
Microsoft ASP.NET Core, Razor Pages and the C# programming language. We were introduced to the concept of Views and Models with Razor Pages and to the ASP .NET Model-View-Controller (MVC) web development framework. Also, we covered many web development related concepts such as databases, servers, configuration files, LINQ, SQLITE, Entity Framework and page validation. 

**Please note** that, due to the really short length of the Developing ASP .NET Applications class (2 weeks and a half, approximately), not all features are fully implemented, the use of CSS doesn't fully respect the industry standards, and testing wasn't implemented.

## Usage

Download the project folder and run it in MS Visual Studio Code. 

**Make sure** you have .NET installed on your machine. If you don't, head over to [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) 🔗.

Open a terminal window and run these commands for DB migration :

* dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
* dotnet ef migrations add CreateDatabase --output-dir Data/Migrations
* dotnet ef database update

* dotnet build
* dotnet run

You can open the DB in [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) 🔗 and put in some seed data, but **I don't recommend you do it this way**. Instead, follow the next few steps.

* Login as admin
  * Username: admin1@admin.com
  * Password: Admin123!
* Add some data in services and food.
* Logout and Register as a farmer.
* Head over to Add Farm, in the dropdown menu of the navbar, and add one or two farms.
* Logout and Register as a regular user.
* Login and explore the farms with the search bar and write your first review!

To experiment the use of authentication and authorization, that are implemented to make sure that a regular user can't access admin functionalities for example, try accessing /Admin as a regular user and /Account/EditUser without being signed in.

## Technologies Used

* Razor Pages
* .NET Core
* Identity in ASP .NET Core
* Authentication/Authorization
* SQLite
* Entity Framework
* Bootstrap
